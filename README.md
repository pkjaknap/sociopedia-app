## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create an account, log in, and log out securely. This ensures that user data and interactions are protected.

- **User Authorization**: Proper authorization mechanisms are implemented to ensure that users can only access and modify their own data. This prevents unauthorized access and protects user privacy.

- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information, including their name, profile picture, and location. This allows users to personalize their profiles and share relevant information with others.

- **Post Creation**: Users can create and publish posts, including text descriptions and optional image attachments. This allows users to share their thoughts, experiences, and media content with others.

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images to accompany their posts. The application handles image uploads securely and efficiently, allowing users to enrich their posts with visuals.

- **Like and Comment Functionality**: Users can like and comment on posts to engage in conversations and show appreciation for shared content. This fosters social interaction and community engagement within the application.

- **Friends Management**: Users can add friends within the application, view their friends' profiles, and interact with their friends' posts. This enhances the social aspect of the application and facilitates connections between users.

## Technology Stack

The Sociopedia project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Front-end**: The front-end is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux Toolkit is employed for efficient state management, enabling predictable and scalable application behavior.

- **Back-end**: The back-end is developed using a server-side technology stack such as Node.js, Express.js, and a database system like MongoDB. These technologies handle user authentication, authorization, and data storage.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Full-stack authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented using industry-standard techniques, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and secure password hashing. This ensures secure access to user accounts and protected data.

- **Image Upload**: The application utilizes appropriate libraries or services to handle image upload functionality. This may involve storing images in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or utilizing dedicated image hosting platforms.

- **Database**: The project employs a database system, such as MongoDB, to store user profiles, posts, comments, likes, and other relevant data. The database facilitates efficient retrieval and storage of information, ensuring a seamless user experience.
